## Bluish Portfolio

This is the first version of my portfolio, I decided to mix different blue colors in my Figma project and the result was pretty cool

## Getting Started :rocket:

## Technologies :fire:

I used these technologies:

- [Next.js (App Directory)](https://nextjs.org/) - an awesome React Framework.
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - my favorite library to manage the CSS.
- [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) - my first time with an impressive library to manage the animations.
- [Zustand](https://zustand-demo.pmnd.rs/) - a magic and fast solution for State Management.
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) - a pretty good library to work with icons.
- [i18next](https://i18next.com/) - a pretty cool solution to manage the [Internationalization](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/i18n).
- [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) - it's just an awesome approach to manage the Design System and UI Testing.
